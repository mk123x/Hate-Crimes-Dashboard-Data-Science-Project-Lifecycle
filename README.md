# Hate-Crimes-Dashboard-DSPL

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Science Project Lifecycle module.The project focuses on building an interactive Streamlit d ashboard that visualises hate crime incidents in Austin, Texas, from 2017–2025. The dashboard enables users to explore trends over time, identify affected groups, and understand distribution of incidents.

The project involved creating an interactive user experience through filters and graphs. This dashboard is useful for policymakers, researchers, and the public to better understand patterns of hate crime, identify areas for intervention, and support informed decision-making. 

Libraries and Tools used:

- **`streamlit`** – for building the interactive dashboard web app

- **`pandas`** – for loading, cleaning, and exploring structured datasets

- **`matplotlib`** – for generating visualisations and plots

- **`numpy`** – for numerical operations and supporting data analysis

Content includes my full report and my Streamlit app code.

The dataset used for this project is the Hate Crime 2017–2025 dataset available from data.gov at the following link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hate-crimes-2024

This project was completed as part of my second-year BSc Data Science and Analytics course.
